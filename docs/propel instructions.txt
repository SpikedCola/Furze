propel instructions

installation
- install composer if not already done - `cd [repository root]; composer update`.
- copy `database/propel.php` to `source/classes/vendor/bin/`.
- double-check your `source/config.php` file making sure database credentials are correct.

making changes to existing schema.xml
- modify `database/schema.xml` as necessary
- cd to `source/classes/vendor/bin/`
- run `propel build` to rebuild the classes in `source/classes/Propel/`. note that any changes made to the skeleton classes in 
`source/classes/Propel/` will be kept and not overwritten. however changes inside `source/classes/Propel/{Base,Map}` will be overwritten. 
typically these are not touched, and all changes kept to the skeleton classes.

reverse-engineering an existing database, to create schema.xml for you
- make table in phpmyadmin, add/change columns, whatever.
- cd to `source/classes/vendor/bin/`
- run `propel database:reverse`. this generates `source/classes/vendor/bin/generated-reversed-database/schema.xml`
- create/modify `database/schema.xml` using `source/classes/vendor/bin/generated-reversed-database/schema.xml` as a reference
- once happy, run `propel build` as above to build classes from schema.xml
